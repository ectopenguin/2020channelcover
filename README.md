# 2020channelcover
Soft mesh cover that fits inside a 2020 extrusion channel to cover cables.
When building my Voron 2.4, I had issues with extrusion covers for this purpose, as they protruded enough for the belts to rub on them. I used these to hide wiring for the lighting.

Print Settings (feel free to experiment): 2 outer walls, 0 top and bottom walls, 40% line infill. 

The result is a flexible mesh that can slide down an extrusion, even past the screw of a blind joint. Then thread your wires behind it and that's all there is to it. Can resize to length or print multiple to stack.

Enjoy!
