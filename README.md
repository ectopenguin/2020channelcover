# 2020channelcover
Soft mesh cover that fits inside a 2020 extrusion channel to cover cables.

I printed with 2 outer walls, 0 top and bottom walls, 40% line infill. The result is a flexible mesh that can slide down an extrusion, even past the screw of a blind joint. Then thread your wires behind it and that's all there is to it. Can resize to length or print multiple to stack.

Enjoy!
